Spent more time on alto's adventure which\nis probably a step up assuming it doesn't get out of hand.</p>\n<h2>E – Have I exercised well this week?</h2>\n<p>No dedicated exercise but did get a lot of yard work done in the unseasonably\nwarm weather.</p>\n<h2>I – What have I done for myself this week?</h2>\n<p>Since it was vacation, almost everything was whatever I wanted to do. Most\nnotably we got a solo stove and I've been doing a fireside meditations that have\nfelt great.</p>\n<h2>O – What have I done for others this week?</h2>\n<p>Looking to play more with Reyan, he is growing up quickly and still wants to\nplay all the time.</p>\n<h2>U – Do I have any unexpressed emotions?</h2>\n<p>I've been feeling exceptionally free lately - noticing when I am internally\nasking for permission for things I shouldn't ever really need permission for and\ndeciding to \"unclench\" and allow myself permission.</p>\n<h2>Y – The “yeah” factor; what brought me joy this week?</h2>\n<p>Getting the beach tent out on the deck and playing trains in it with Reyan was\nawesome in this nice weather. Certainly not what I was expecting to be doing on\nnewyears eve.</p>","title":"Journal-entry-2","date":"2023-01-02","tags":["Journal"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
