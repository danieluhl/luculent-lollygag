<p>Fair warning, I'm getting into stoic philosophy a bit here. If you're not into
the stoic perspective, I recommend looking up research on growth vs static
mindset. Same junk different name üòã</p>
<p>Tragedy is severe an unwarranted injustice where nobody is at fault. The
circumstances of nature happen to come together in a way that something awful
happens and it's pointless.</p>
<p>I was playing a video game the other day and started reflecting on the several
mistakes I made - mostly around optimizing for time/resources. The thought is,
if I had more information, awareness, reaction time, etc. I would have taken a
different action.</p>
<p>I started thinking, what's the difference between a tragedy and a mistake?</p>
<p>Stoic philosophy often points towards determinism, that is, we cannot change the
past and given the trajectory of the universe we also cannot alter the future.
We can learn from the past and adjust our actions and all of this is
predictable. The question I often get when talking to others about this is, "so
what? How does this change anything about how I live". This is a great question
for any philosophical line of thinking.</p>
<p>In the case of determinism, the hurdle of understanding its truth is just the
start, and most people have trouble getting past that. But humor me for a moment
and assume determinism is true. This assumption sets us down an interesting path
chain of logic!</p>
<p>Let's look at a common occurrence when a player makes a mistake in a video game:
the other players blame them for losing the game, the player may hit their
keyboard and blame the speed of their computer, everyone <em>feels</em> awful.</p>
<p>None of this makes sense from a lens of determinism. Instead, we can think
deeply about all the factors that led up to the moment of that mistake with the
knowledge that it was inevitable given the situation. We stop thinking in terms
of agency and start thinking in systems!</p>
<p>Regret, guilt, and blame do not exist in this worldview, there is no place for
them, instead we get technical, creative, and curious.</p>
<p>What if the computer was a factor? How could I test that? How can I most
accurately re-create the situation in a simulator to adjust and try different
things to optimize the outcome next time it happens? Maybe I can even get an AI
to do that work for me!</p>
<hr>
<p>I've been in 12 severe car accidents, I know that's a lot, but I swear I'm a
good driver. One particularly bad accident involved getting t-boned by a large
truck completely smashing my car.</p>
<p>This left me quite shaken up and I spent the entire night re-living the few
hours before the accident: "if only I hadn't forgot my wallet and gone back in
the house", "if only I hadn't taken extra time in the shower", "if I had taken a
different route to work", on and on and on and on. So many events led to us both
being in that exact time and place and boom!</p>
<p>I felt so powerless in that moment: the accident had taken place and there's
nothing I could do to change that fact. This was a key turning point and
realization for me. Stoicism takes this feeling of powerlessness and normalizes
it applying the idea broadly to all events. Yes you're powerless, and that's OK.
In fact, it's better to understand this true nature so you can get past the
mental anguish that would arise otherwise.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is a key moment where it's critical to catch yourself, reflect, and
practice making mental adjustments by thinking through the deterministic
worldview. The key moment to look for is just when you realize you've made a
mistake. Take a moment to check what's going on in your body and mind. What is
your natural thought process? How do you feel? Does your heart rate go up, maybe
tightness in the chest or lump in the throat, maybe a sinking feeling?</p>
<p>With practice you can replace the typical default bad feelings of regret, loss,
and guilt with immediate curiosity: "huh, I wonder why that happened". Remove
your <strong>self</strong> from the equation by default and you'll quickly find yourself
chuckling on the inside by others' reactions.</p></div></article><button style="font-size:1.4em;background:none;border:none;cursor:pointer">üëç</button></main><div class="layout_backToHome__9sjx_"><a href="/">‚Üê Back to home</a></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"04-29-mistake-vs-tragedy","contentHtml":"\u003ch1\u003eMistake Vs Tragedy\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFair warning, I'm getting into stoic philosophy a bit here.
