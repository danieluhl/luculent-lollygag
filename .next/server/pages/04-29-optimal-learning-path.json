{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"04-29-optimal-learning-path","contentHtml":"<h1>Optimal Learning Path</h1>\n<p>Here's my attempt at outlining my current optimal learning path for most new\nthings. You may be totally different, but this is what I've personally found\noptimal for myself.</p>\n<p>After each of these steps, it might be enough to stop the learning path because\nyou have everything you need. You may also want to skip a step if you're\nstudying something adjacent to your current knowledge and <em>probably</em> can get\naway with jumping through quickly.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction to the Technology</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For most tools you'll want to first know what it does so you know it will solve\nyour use case. But you also want to know that it's well supported and idiomatic\nin the community so that you'll have reasonable support and others will be able\nto pick up your code easier down the road. You also want to know your size and\nspeed considerations are met.</p>\n<p>For frameworks or large tooling you may not need any of this, you might be\ndiving in because a friend told you it's awesome. In this case the best first\nstep is direct exposure to what it's like to develop with the tool. Nothing\nbeats a good example to fiddle with or video of the same. Pair this with some\nexplanation material about why things are the way they are and why it's so\nawesome.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Solving a Problem</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After first exposure you want to get something working end to end. A good base\ncase tutorial works best for this when it explicitly doesn't include any fluff\nor explanation. Simple, up-to-date, easy to follow steps that anyone can follow\nwithout knowing what they're doing to get something working.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Off the Happy Path</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once we've solved the base case problem, now we want to solve <em>my</em> problem. This\nmeans fiddling with things that are going to break. Now that I have exposure to\nthe tool and have something working I'll want to break it and fix it over and\nover until it's doing what I want. For this I'm going to need all the options\nwith clear APIs and reference material that's comprehensive and easy to search.\nIt can also help to provide several working examples showing common use cases.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Mastery</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now that we're up and running and know the 80% use case APIs we can solve all\nkinds of problems. At this point we look like some kind of magic wizard to\nnon-engineers. But this is not enough. We want to look like a wizard to other\nengineers. Or, maybe we just have a super tricky edge case to figure out.</p>\n<p>For this we dive into the github repos pull requests, github issues, and of\ncourse, read the source! Source code should be well structured and commented. If\nyou find something difficult or confusing check if there's a contributing guide\nand make a pull request. You'll find most library owners are happy to discuss\ntheir code and often take suggestions for improvement (but don't assume they\nwill).</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Tune in to Updates</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's essential to keep libraries and tooling that you're using up-to-date. If\nit's a big enough deal they may have a newsletter. Otherwise you may want to\ncheck in with forums or the community from time to time to double check that\nyour knowledge about the right tool for the job is still the best path.</p>\n<p>If the environment has shifted, head back up to #1 and begin again! This is the\nfun and beauty of engineering, there will always be a new and interesting thing\nto discover. The more we take this path the easier it gets and the more fun it\nis.</p>","title":"Optimal Learning Path","date":"2021-04-29","tags":["emotion"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
