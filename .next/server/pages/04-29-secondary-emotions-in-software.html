<p>Secondary emotions are the judgements of primary emotions. For example, I'm
afraid I'll lose control when I get angry. Anger is the primary emotion and fear
is the secondary emotion.</p>
<p>It's important to identify and be cognizant of secondary emotions because they
can mask over primary emotions. This makes it difficult to express primary
emotions in a healthy way.</p>
<h2>Cutting the crap by digging deep?</h2>
<p>Half way through a difficult week I'll often feel like I've made no progress on
my long-term goals. I've been fighting fires for days and feel like I'm not
learning and growing. I go to my one-on-one meeting with my manager and he asks,
"how is it going"? I say things are terrible, our teams are too junior and don't
know what they're doing. Our systems teams are slow and incapable. Our code is a
mess and our site lacks reliability.</p>
<p>In this example I'm showing anger, disappointment, and frustration. But what is
my primary emotion? Emotions can be difficult to identify, I recommend finding a
good <a href="https://dontmindmeblog.com/2017/12/23/primary-and-secondary-emotions/">emotion
wheel</a>.
In this case, when I dig deep down I find that the primary emotion is actually
fear. Fear that I'm not making progress by learning and growing, that my role
may not be what I thought and I may have to change jobs, that I'm not living up
to the expectations in my role and I might get a bad review.</p>
<p>It might be true that our systems and teams are a mess, but expressing anger in
the heat of the moment is entirely unproductive to my career. If instead I
expressed my fear about my own career and the activities I've been doing in a
healthy way, then I can shortcut potentially weeks or months of anger and
frustration.</p>
<p>Let's replay the scenario, my manager asks, "how's it going"? I identify my
primary and secondary emotions and take a big shortcut straight to what would be
helpful for me. I explain how I feel lost, like I'm spinning my wheels. I share
the mis-match in expectations for my role and open up about what helps me feel
fulfilled and happy. We work together on a plan to incrementally move me in the
right direction and my manager has gained critical insight into how to help me
move quickly in my career.</p>
<h2>Vulnerability = seniority</h2>
<p>Primary emotions are important indicators that we need to learn to express in a
constructive, healthy, and professional way. Often this is through candid
feedback and vulnerable conversation.</p>
<p>Being vulnerable is more difficult than giving in to a secondary emotion. We
fall back on our secondary emotions because they take the difficult primary
emotions and our responsibility to deal with them out of the picture.</p>
<p>However, you'll not only feel better as a self-fulfilled person by tackling
primary emotions head-on, but you'll be accelerated through your career.
Emotional maturity and the ability to give good feedback are hallmarks of senior
engineers. This maturity is difficult to build, but easy to spot, and every
great leader I've worked with has it.</p></div></article><button style="font-size:1.4em;background:none;border:none;cursor:pointer">üëç</button></main><div class="layout_backToHome__9sjx_"><a href="/">‚Üê Back to home</a></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"04-29-secondary-emotions-in-software","contentHtml":"\u003ch1\u003eWhat are secondary emotions?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondary emotions are the judgements of primary emotions.
