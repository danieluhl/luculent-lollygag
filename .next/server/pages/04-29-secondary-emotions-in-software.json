For example, I'm\nafraid I'll lose control when I get angry. Anger is the primary emotion and fear\nis the secondary emotion.</p>\n<p>It's important to identify and be cognizant of secondary emotions because they\ncan mask over primary emotions. This makes it difficult to express primary\nemotions in a healthy way.</p>\n<h2>Cutting the crap by digging deep?</h2>\n<p>Half way through a difficult week I'll often feel like I've made no progress on\nmy long-term goals. I've been fighting fires for days and feel like I'm not\nlearning and growing. I go to my one-on-one meeting with my manager and he asks,\n\"how is it going\"? I say things are terrible, our teams are too junior and don't\nknow what they're doing. Our systems teams are slow and incapable. Our code is a\nmess and our site lacks reliability.</p>\n<p>In this example I'm showing anger, disappointment, and frustration. But what is\nmy primary emotion? Emotions can be difficult to identify, I recommend finding a\ngood <a href=\"https://dontmindmeblog.com/2017/12/23/primary-and-secondary-emotions/\">emotion\nwheel</a>.\nIn this case, when I dig deep down I find that the primary emotion is actually\nfear. Fear that I'm not making progress by learning and growing, that my role\nmay not be what I thought and I may have to change jobs, that I'm not living up\nto the expectations in my role and I might get a bad review.</p>\n<p>It might be true that our systems and teams are a mess, but expressing anger in\nthe heat of the moment is entirely unproductive to my career. If instead I\nexpressed my fear about my own career and the activities I've been doing in a\nhealthy way, then I can shortcut potentially weeks or months of anger and\nfrustration.</p>\n<p>Let's replay the scenario, my manager asks, \"how's it going\"? I identify my\nprimary and secondary emotions and take a big shortcut straight to what would be\nhelpful for me. I explain how I feel lost, like I'm spinning my wheels. I share\nthe mis-match in expectations for my role and open up about what helps me feel\nfulfilled and happy. We work together on a plan to incrementally move me in the\nright direction and my manager has gained critical insight into how to help me\nmove quickly in my career.</p>\n<h2>Vulnerability = seniority</h2>\n<p>Primary emotions are important indicators that we need to learn to express in a\nconstructive, healthy, and professional way. Often this is through candid\nfeedback and vulnerable conversation.</p>\n<p>Being vulnerable is more difficult than giving in to a secondary emotion. We\nfall back on our secondary emotions because they take the difficult primary\nemotions and our responsibility to deal with them out of the picture.</p>\n<p>However, you'll not only feel better as a self-fulfilled person by tackling\nprimary emotions head-on, but you'll be accelerated through your career.\nEmotional maturity and the ability to give good feedback are hallmarks of senior\nengineers. This maturity is difficult to build, but easy to spot, and every\ngreat leader I've worked with has it.</p>","title":"Secondary Emotions In Software","date":"2021-04-29"}},"__N_SSG":true}
