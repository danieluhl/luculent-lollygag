One\nkey piece of advice is to never sleep in the snow.</p>\n<p>Your body will get\ncomfortable and start to fall asleep. Your limbs will be too cold to feel so a\nsort of comfort will fall over you and you'll want to rest... forever.</p>\n<p>This situation is not unlike the comfort zone, learning zone, and anxiety zone\nwe hear about in the \"learning zone model\". If your career is in the comfort\nzone, your career will die. Always be learning and adapting because you never\nwalk in the same stream twice.</p>","title":"Comfort Zone is Danger","date":"2022-05-11"}},"__N_SSG":true}
