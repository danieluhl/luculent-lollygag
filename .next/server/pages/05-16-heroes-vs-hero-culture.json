This may seem impossible to avoid and even a fair\nsystem. Why shouldn't the hardest working people get more reward?</p>\n<p>Just as we must recognize that most wealthy people obtained their wealth on the\nsupport structures of society largely by being lucky, we can also must recognize\nthat heroes are built on the backs of great supporting teams.</p>\n<p>We can improve the distribution of reward by separating pay from promotion and\nby introducing other means of recognition.</p>\n<p>The rockstar may get the promotion quickly but the person doing the glue work\nand enabling the quick progress gets a big raise and other recognition for being\na key part of the team.</p>","title":"Heroes vs Hero Culture","date":"2022-05-16"}},"__N_SSG":true}
