{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"05-20-illusion-of-the-perfect-buddha","contentHtml":"<p>When I was on silent meditation retreat for the first time I went from 10\nminutes per day to 10 hours per day and from sitting in a train car to sitting\non a floor with no back support.</p>\n<p>The experienced students sit in front, so if you do open your eyes (you're not\nsupposed to, but everyone does) you see these perfect Buddha postures sitting\nperfectly still. I became instantly jealous of their refined abilities (and\nstrong backs).</p>\n<p>But over time I came to realize I was admiring entirely the wrong attributes and\nhad no reason to be jealous. Yes it takes some skill and practice to sit still,\nbut it's analogous to admiring a swimmer for how well they wear a life vest\nwhile standing in shallow water. Sitting in a quiet dark room with air\nconditioning is \"easy mode\". Show the same calm in everyday life. Show it on the\nworst days. This is something to be truly admired.</p>\n<p>Now, when sitting at home doing my own practice, I no loner look at finding my\nquiet place and sitting with good posture as a skill to learn or burden. I see\nit as a relief and a way to make it easier for just a little time. To go back to\nthe shallows to stand and get some rest before diving back into the deep.</p>","title":"Illusion Of The Perfect Buddha","date":"2021-05-20"}},"__N_SSG":true}
