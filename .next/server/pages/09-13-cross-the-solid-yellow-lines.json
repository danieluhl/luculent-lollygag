This is what we learn when starting to drive. My literal mind said, \"oh yeah?!\" and crossed the line quite easily, as a car is much bigger and capable than that small yellow line.</p>\n<p>Legality aside, there are tons of mental blocks we put up especially around social norms. We've built up such a complex that we can't even see the physical possibility of crossing that line.</p>\n<p>For example, think about buying something, walking out of the store, and immediately walking back in and returning it. Does thinking about this give you anxiety? Is this a yellow line that should not be crossed? What biases or pre-conceived notions drive the anxiety? If you immediately regret your purchase or felt pushed around by a sales person, then go return the thing!</p>\n<p>A couple caveats for this path of experiential exploration:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensure your actions are safe and lawful (unlike passing with a solid yellow line)</li>\n<li>Think through the worst case scenario. This can also give you confidence and set good expectations.</li>\n<li>If the action gives you significant anxiety, invite a friend along and explain what you're doing so they can be there to support if things go sideways.</li>\n</ol>","title":"Cross the Solid Yellow Lines","date":"2021-09-13"}},"__N_SSG":true}
