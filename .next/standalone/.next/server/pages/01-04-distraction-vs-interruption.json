It's when the unexpected happens (it always will). It's when you took the wrong trade-offs or made the wrong set of assumptions. It's when technology shifts from under you and you need to learn something new or change careers.</p>\n<p>What's fundamental here is that interruption is so consistent as to be the norm. We should not be upset by interruptions, they are life. Moreover, they are the signal that things are unfolding as they should.
