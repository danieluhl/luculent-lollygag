This is the groundwork, removing known\nblockers.</p>\n<p>Next grab all the silverware at once, and nothing else.  Take this one effort\nall at once, don't also try to put away cups or plates at the same time, your\nfull attention is required here.</p>\n<p>Pull the knives out of the bunch, there should be relative few of them and\nremoving them first simplifies our work moving forward. Exponential gains on the\nlarge portion of the work for a little manual work up-front.</p>\n<p>Now we should be down to forks and spoons time to execute quickly with minimal\neffort.  Pick forks or spoons to focus on first, it doesn't matter which. If\nyou're focusing on forks, take individual or groups of forks as you see them and\ndrop them in the forks spot. Everything else goes in the spoons spot, don't\nthink about if it's a spoon or not, just let it drop. Effectively you're\nautomating the most repetitive part of the operation.</p>\n<p>You will make a few errors because you're moving so fast and giving such little\nthought. Get comfortable with this and clean up those couple mistakes later.\nDon't feel bad about them, that will only make the situation worse. Instead,\naccept that they will be there, it's part of nature.</p>\n<p>If you (or others you live with) feel the need to separate large from small\nspoons, I suggest changing your mindset to be comfortable with a level of\nmixing. It's much easier to see/grab the right size when you need it rather than\ndoing this fine-grained sorting when putting away because it's a task that\nhappens in very small chunks over time.</p>","title":"Putting the Dishes Away","date":"2022-02-14"}},"__N_SSG":true}
