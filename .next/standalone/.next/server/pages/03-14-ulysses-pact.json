{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"03-14-ulysses-pact","contentHtml":"<p>I think a lot about the Ulysses pact. The idea that in this moment you have\nstrong intentions about the future, but you know your future self is weak, so\nyou set your future self up for success now by making the right thing the easy\nthing.</p>\n<p>You can target the thing you're supposed to be doing (Ulysses sailing past the\nrocks), for example, set aside time, space, energy for a specific task. In\nsimplest terms, set an alarm that will remind you to do something or book it on\nthe calendar.</p>\n<p>Or you can target the siren song of distraction. Sell your video games, get\nYouTube blocking software, etc.</p>\n<h2>A Deeper Insight</h2>\n<p>The above tactics are great, and they work, but I've found I'm mistakenly taking\nmy situation for a Ulysses Pact situation when, in reality, the siren song is\nalready here, and I must choose in this moment to be strong and resist or not.</p>\n<p>In other words, you don't get to wait, you are living in this moment, are you\ndistracted? If you can do the right thing NOW then you can do the right thing\nlater. Now is what matters more, don't wait.</p>","title":"Ulysses Pact","date":"2022-03-14"}},"__N_SSG":true}
