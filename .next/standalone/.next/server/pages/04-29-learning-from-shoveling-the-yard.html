<p>Living in the northeast shoveling driveways is a known pain. This year I got a small electric snowblower which helped a bit but it's always been a chore. My back aches after, it's cold and wet and often early in the morning so we can get the car out for the day.</p>
<h2>I need a sledding hill!</h2>
<p>This year due to travel restrictions it didn't make much sense to take our usual winter vacation out of state. I have a 1yo boy and I wanted to introduce him to sledding. Local tubing places have height restrictions he does not meet.</p>
<p>After much research I looked out the window and realized I have a pretty good slope in my yard. Just need to pile up some snow. So I took an afternoon and built a curving path with walls so you don't fly out and a big wall at the end to catch you. It was awesome. The baby giggled the whole way down. We spent the next two weeks tubing every day!</p>
<h2>Wait, shoveling is awesome?</h2>
<p>Only in later reflection did it hit me: the activity of shoveling in the yard was physically the same as shoveling the driveway, but my mental state was profoundly different. I actually enjoyed it. How could this be? And, if I can deconstruct this phenomenon, could I enjoy shoveling the yard just as much? Or even expand this to apply to other chores I dislike?</p>
<h2>Key differences</h2>
<p><strong>Driveway</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Needs to be done (no autonomy)</li>
<li>Known solution (no creativity)</li>
<li>Same every year (no variety)</li>
<li>Result is restored ability to drive the car</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Yard</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I had the idea</li>
<li>I decided <em>how</em> to form the hill</li>
<li>I did the work on my time</li>
<li>I planned out each phase, got creative with the process</li>
<li>Result is something both I and others enjoy</li>
</ul>
<h2>Shifting State of Mind</h2>
<p>If something is boring, turn it into a game. Maybe next time I'll try to get all the snow in one area and build an igloo.</p>
<p>When my wife pesters me to go shovel I shouldn't take this as a burden, but as a sign of how grateful she is that I'm around to take care of these sorts of tasks. I'm much happier when I'm doing something that I know others will enjoy.</p></div></article><button style="font-size:1.4em;background:none;border:none;cursor:pointer">üëç</button></main><div class="layout_backToHome__9sjx_"><a href="/">‚Üê Back to home</a></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"04-29-learning-from-shoveling-the-yard","contentHtml":"\u003ch1\u003eShoveling Sucks\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiving in the northeast shoveling driveways is a known pain.
