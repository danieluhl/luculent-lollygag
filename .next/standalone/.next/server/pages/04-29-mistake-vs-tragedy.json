If you're not into\nthe stoic perspective, I recommend looking up research on growth vs static\nmindset. Same junk different name ðŸ˜‹</p>\n<p>Tragedy is severe an unwarranted injustice where nobody is at fault. The\ncircumstances of nature happen to come together in a way that something awful\nhappens and it's pointless.</p>\n<p>I was playing a video game the other day and started reflecting on the several\nmistakes I made - mostly around optimizing for time/resources. The thought is,\nif I had more information, awareness, reaction time, etc. I would have taken a\ndifferent action.</p>\n<p>I started thinking, what's the difference between a tragedy and a mistake?</p>\n<p>Stoic philosophy often points towards determinism, that is, we cannot change the\npast and given the trajectory of the universe we also cannot alter the future.\nWe can learn from the past and adjust our actions and all of this is\npredictable. The question I often get when talking to others about this is, \"so\nwhat? How does this change anything about how I live\". This is a great question\nfor any philosophical line of thinking.</p>\n<p>In the case of determinism, the hurdle of understanding its truth is just the\nstart, and most people have trouble getting past that. But humor me for a moment\nand assume determinism is true. This assumption sets us down an interesting path\nchain of logic!</p>\n<p>Let's look at a common occurrence when a player makes a mistake in a video game:\nthe other players blame them for losing the game, the player may hit their\nkeyboard and blame the speed of their computer, everyone <em>feels</em> awful.</p>\n<p>None of this makes sense from a lens of determinism. Instead, we can think\ndeeply about all the factors that led up to the moment of that mistake with the\nknowledge that it was inevitable given the situation. We stop thinking in terms\nof agency and start thinking in systems!</p>\n<p>Regret, guilt, and blame do not exist in this worldview, there is no place for\nthem, instead we get technical, creative, and curious.</p>\n<p>What if the computer was a factor? How could I test that? How can I most\naccurately re-create the situation in a simulator to adjust and try different\nthings to optimize the outcome next time it happens? Maybe I can even get an AI\nto do that work for me!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I've been in 12 severe car accidents, I know that's a lot, but I swear I'm a\ngood driver. One particularly bad accident involved getting t-boned by a large\ntruck completely smashing my car.</p>\n<p>This left me quite shaken up and I spent the entire night re-living the few\nhours before the accident: \"if only I hadn't forgot my wallet and gone back in\nthe house\", \"if only I hadn't taken extra time in the shower\", \"if I had taken a\ndifferent route to work\", on and on and on and on. So many events led to us both\nbeing in that exact time and place and boom!</p>\n<p>I felt so powerless in that moment: the accident had taken place and there's\nnothing I could do to change that fact. This was a key turning point and\nrealization for me. Stoicism takes this feeling of powerlessness and normalizes\nit applying the idea broadly to all events. Yes you're powerless, and that's OK.\nIn fact, it's better to understand this true nature so you can get past the\nmental anguish that would arise otherwise.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There is a key moment where it's critical to catch yourself, reflect, and\npractice making mental adjustments by thinking through the deterministic\nworldview. The key moment to look for is just when you realize you've made a\nmistake. Take a moment to check what's going on in your body and mind. What is\nyour natural thought process? How do you feel? Does your heart rate go up, maybe\ntightness in the chest or lump in the throat, maybe a sinking feeling?</p>\n<p>With practice you can replace the typical default bad feelings of regret, loss,\nand guilt with immediate curiosity: \"huh, I wonder why that happened\". Remove\nyour <strong>self</strong> from the equation by default and you'll quickly find yourself\nchuckling on the inside by others' reactions.</p>","title":"Mistake Vs Tragedy","date":"2021-04-29"}},"__N_SSG":true}
