<p>A well kept secret of great painters is that their job eventually turns into a
mix of chemistry, cooking, and trial and error science when they begin to make
their own paint. Painters and other artists will spend decades coming up with
the perfect recipe for the perfect paint that is able to convey story, emotion,
color, or light in just the right way to make their art unique, interesting, and
overall better.</p>
<p>Not all master painters make their own paint. Some will stick to what they know
works well enough and exploit the substance in new and interesting ways. Or
simply choose the best path to market the art to the masses. However, one might
ask, if the painter is truly dedicated to the craft and it consumes their being,
wouldn't they eventually dig into how the materials were made? I haven't even
talked about brushes üòÖ</p>
<h2>Engineering Eventuality</h2>
<p>A few years ago at the large software engineering org I worked in there was a
well known general feeling that the platforms team were ivory tower elite
engineers. That their job was nearly unattainable to the feature team engineers.
After all, they not only know how to write code, they can write code that
engineers use to write code. They know how to make paint.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the org didn't like the "ivory tower" mentality. It made
feature team engineers feel like they were stuck and had no future on the team.
Like the best would need to "graduate" to a platform team or risk career
stagnation. So we pushed back against the concept and began to build a culture
where you could be a great engineer on any team and platforms teams were just
like any other.</p>
<p>But there was one problem with this approach: there was a hint of truth to the
idea of graduating to a platforms team. It's not so much about the team, but
about the idea of an engineer coming to a point in their career where they want
to make their own paint. They have the knowledge and skill to push the tooling
to the next level and multiply their impact and to give back to other engineers.</p>
<h2>The Next Generation of Painters</h2>
<p>Senior engineers on feature development teams need not leave their team to begin
making their own paint. In fact, there's opportunity to build a better
connection between feature teams and platforms teams. Senior engineers can
understand and contribute to feature team development, and help them better</p></div></article><button style="font-size:1.4em;background:none;border:none;cursor:pointer">üëç</button></main><div class="layout_backToHome__9sjx_"><a href="/">‚Üê Back to home</a></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"04-29-painting-is-chemistry","contentHtml":"\u003ch1\u003ePainting Is Chemistry\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA well kept secret of great painters is that their job eventually turns into a\nmix of chemistry, cooking, and trial and error science when they begin to make\ntheir own paint.
