{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"04-29-painting-is-chemistry","contentHtml":"<h1>Painting Is Chemistry</h1>\n<p>A well kept secret of great painters is that their job eventually turns into a\nmix of chemistry, cooking, and trial and error science when they begin to make\ntheir own paint. Painters and other artists will spend decades coming up with\nthe perfect recipe for the perfect paint that is able to convey story, emotion,\ncolor, or light in just the right way to make their art unique, interesting, and\noverall better.</p>\n<p>Not all master painters make their own paint. Some will stick to what they know\nworks well enough and exploit the substance in new and interesting ways. Or\nsimply choose the best path to market the art to the masses. However, one might\nask, if the painter is truly dedicated to the craft and it consumes their being,\nwouldn't they eventually dig into how the materials were made? I haven't even\ntalked about brushes ðŸ˜…</p>\n<h2>Engineering Eventuality</h2>\n<p>A few years ago at the large software engineering org I worked in there was a\nwell known general feeling that the platforms team were ivory tower elite\nengineers. That their job was nearly unattainable to the feature team engineers.\nAfter all, they not only know how to write code, they can write code that\nengineers use to write code. They know how to make paint.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the org didn't like the \"ivory tower\" mentality. It made\nfeature team engineers feel like they were stuck and had no future on the team.\nLike the best would need to \"graduate\" to a platform team or risk career\nstagnation. So we pushed back against the concept and began to build a culture\nwhere you could be a great engineer on any team and platforms teams were just\nlike any other.</p>\n<p>But there was one problem with this approach: there was a hint of truth to the\nidea of graduating to a platforms team. It's not so much about the team, but\nabout the idea of an engineer coming to a point in their career where they want\nto make their own paint. They have the knowledge and skill to push the tooling\nto the next level and multiply their impact and to give back to other engineers.</p>\n<h2>The Next Generation of Painters</h2>\n<p>Senior engineers on feature development teams need not leave their team to begin\nmaking their own paint. In fact, there's opportunity to build a better\nconnection between feature teams and platforms teams. Senior engineers can\nunderstand and contribute to feature team development, and help them better</p>","title":"Painting Is Chemistry","date":"2021-04-29","tags":["awareness"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
