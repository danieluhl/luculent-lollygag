Look how many hundreds of thousands of people make a living playing\nvideo games.</p>\n<p>When you find work that is also fun, or find someone to pay you for having fun,\ndon't squander it or shy away. What's fun for you may not be fun for everyone\nand that's ok. I learned at an early age that I actually enjoy doing dishes.\nSometimes I strategically kept this a bit of a secret to help build good will,\nbut it's carried me well through a few restaurant jobs and with keeping things\ntidy at home.</p>\n<p>Learning and growing can also be fun, this doensn't mean it's not work or that\nit's not your job.</p>","title":"Can Work be Fun?","date":"2021-06-02"}},"__N_SSG":true}
