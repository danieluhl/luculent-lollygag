{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"06-29-enjoy-complementary-interests","contentHtml":"<p>I used to get major FOMO (fear of missing out) when I heard about activity that\nothers in my organization were doing that vaguely related to what I was doing or\nthat were what I wanted to be doing.</p>\n<p>I would think things like, \"why wasn't I consulted on this\", or, \"who died and\nmade you king of that thing\". I felt others didn't have the right to pursue\ntheir passion if it aligned too closely with mine.</p>\n<p>Closely associated with this thought is the fallacy (I forget the exact name)\nthat says everyone needs to be caring about the most important thing at all\ntimes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"How can you worry about the price of fruit when a genocide is happening?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We must accept that each person has different interests and passions and while\nit is important to generally be good and charitable people, we have to accept\nthat not everyone should be focusing on the same thing at the same time.</p>\n<p>The same goes for work. I've transitioned from FOMO to a position of\nencouragement and service because I know the more people in my organization\npassionate about he same things I am, the more the organization will remain a\nplace I love to work. Now I celebrate those who go above and beyond doing what\nthey (and I) love to do and get promoted for it.</p>\n<p>It's a subtle mindset change, but incredibly meaningful for my overall\nhappiness.</p>","title":"Enjoy Complementary Interests","date":"2021-06-29"}},"__N_SSG":true}
