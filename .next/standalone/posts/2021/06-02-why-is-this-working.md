It's so much worse when something is working and you don't know why. If there's
a bug or something broken then you at least have some indication of where the
problem is and a path to experimenting to see what might fix it, but if it's
working and you don't know why then it indicates a fundamental gap in knowledge
about the system and it's time to buckle down for a long night of exploring the
code deeper than before.
