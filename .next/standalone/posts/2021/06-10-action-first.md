I want to be more like a person on my team, let's call them Jill.

## How I Work

- Should we do this?
- How do we plan it?
- Where do we track it, success metrics?
- RFC, respond to comments, get it merged
- Epic + Tickets
- Planning and prioritization, pull it in the sprint
- Who wants to take which tickets?
- I’m taking this one, done! Here’s a PR!

## How Jill Works

- I know what would be awesome…
- Done! Here’s a PR yo

## Attributes to Strive For

- Grounded in reality
- Action first
- Let trust and context drive **fast decisions**
- Don’t let process get in the way of doing what’s best
- Automate paper trails (github)
