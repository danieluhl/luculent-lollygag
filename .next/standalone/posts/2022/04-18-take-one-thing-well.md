For each person you interact with frequently, look for the one great
behaivor/attribute that you can replicate and use to evolve.

People are incredibly complex and interesting. Older people have more memories,
backstory, and most importantly they have build behaviors over time that work
well for them.

It reasons to assume then, no matter your overall impressions of the people
around you, there is likely at least _one_ great attribute you can replicate
from each person you meet.
