Motivation is doing something because there's nothing else you'd rather be
doing. Discipline is doing something despite wanting to do other things because
you know it's the thing you _should_ be doing.

With a sotic mindset, we can turn discipline into motivation by wanting to do
the very thing we should be doing. We can think through the short term suffering
to the long term gains to the endevour. We can reassure ourselves that we are
lucky to be in a position to be able to do the right thing.
