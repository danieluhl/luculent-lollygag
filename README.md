# Luculent Lollygag

Blog written by Daniel Uhl, software engineer and manager who's loves good conversation over good whisky.

Here you'll find myriad topics ranging from software to philosophy but most will be centered around web technologies, management, or developer relations/dev advocacy.

You can also find me on:

* twitter [@danieluhl](https://twitter.com/danieluhl)
* github [@danieluhl](https://github.com/danieluhl)
* dev.to [@danieluhl](https://dev.to/danieluhl)

Or slack me directly in the [virtual coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/) workspace!

Built using the starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

## Scripts

- `yarn post "my new post"` creates a new file in the appropriate date format in the `/posts` directory
- `yarn draft` creates a new draft file in the `/drafts` directory.
- `yarn pubish 123` moves and renames the draft with `id` 123 to the `/posts` directory using the frontematter title as the post name
