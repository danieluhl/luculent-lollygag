A lot of people teach how to create good habits but few talk about dropping bad ones or general routine disruption. Like so many things, doing the difficult thing frequently makes you powerful and in-control.

## Pick a Habit

A good first start would be to stop something for a week. Pick one, reflect, and repeat!

* No phone (keep it around but off just in case)
* No meat
* No alcohol (do quarterly for health reasons)
* No coffee (try tea!)
* No sugar (not full keto, but drop anything you restrict from a kid)
* No TV/Youtube (use browser extension to block sites)
* No social media (same as above)
* No video games

## Keys to Success

Stopping something can be very difficult but there are a few tricks to help you get through the week.

### Plan Ahead

Going without a phone for a week can be a challenge. If you'll need GPS direction you may need to map things out before you go (hello mapquest!) You may need to use your computer more often for calendar, email, chat, etc.

If you're going without meat or other consumable, you'll need to buy more of other foods for the week.

### Remove temptation

If you're going without food or alcohol it helps to have none of those in the house. If you live with someone, let them know what you're doing and see if they're up for joining you. This is easier with friends, hold each other accountable.

### Let others know

Let your friends and family know what you're up to. This is the same for building habits: the more people you tell the more likely you are to take it seriously and they can help hold you accountable.

### Reflect on results

At the end of the day, take mental note of what was more/less challenging. How did you fill the time you would have otherwise spent on your phone or watching TV. Are your assumptions of the value of the habit true? Were you doing too much or too little of that activity?

### (optional) Really deeply reflect on the experience

In a meditative/mindful way, notice how you felt removing an app from your device or leaving the house without your phone. Where are those feelings coming from? What's the deeper motivation or underlying connection to these things. Exploring your subconscious can be incredibly powerful and freeing.

## Gain perspective and adjust

The ability to form and remove habits is without a doubt the most important skill you can learn in life because you _are_ what you _do_. Now that you have some good perspective, don't just jump immediately back into the old habit, make adjustments and evolve!

Here are some examples of insights I've found in my personal adventure:

* No phone: Realized I don't do a good job of preparing for meetings or planning out my day - I lean on my phone for this. Also realized how frequently I check time/calendar/email without benefit.
* No sugar: Amazed at how much sugar I was consuming and just how many things have sugars (pickles!?). I've cut back a lot on sugars ever since this week.
* No coffee: I don't actually need coffee to "wake up" and focus. Tea is a great alternative that gives me less headaches/jitters.
* No videogames: I was spending an enormous amount of time on videogames. I actually failed this week and it had a real impact on my awareness of my own willpower and weakness. At this point I decided to remove the temptation and now I don't own any videogame system other than my phone.
