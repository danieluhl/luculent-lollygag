To grow a mustache you first grow a beard. This happens gradually and feels
natural. People tend to not point it out unless they haven't seen you in a
while. But then you shave everything but the mustache and it's like suddenly you
grew a mustache out of nowhere!

The same can be true of your work. We gradually accumulate more and more tasks
until it comes time to hard the project list. Then it suddenly becomes clearly
defined what your role is. In this way, saying "no" to projects is more
effective at adding clarity and definition around who you are.

Saying "no" is also being honest about your priorities. Some tasks are extremely
appealing but if they will honestly never make priority, it's better to state
that up-front and eliminate them from your brain-space.
