It's probably no surprise to anyone reading this that I think new years resolutions are crap. Why resolve at this arbitrary point in time? Look at the data about how many resolutions are really helpful.

However, much like [Friday Nights](../2021/04-29-cant-stop-wont-stop.md), there is something about the turning of the page of the year that motivates a reflective and goal setting mindset. So if you find yourself unable to control getting caught up in the cultural wave, I have a word of advice. Focus less on goals and more on skills. Not nonsense skills like juggling, but real internal skills that come in handy in all things in life.

Focus on whatever your version of, "I get out of bed even when I donâ€™t feel like it", is that pushes you towards your goals.
