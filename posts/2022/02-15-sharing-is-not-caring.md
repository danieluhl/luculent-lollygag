It's easier to share/broadcast information than to make real progress learning
and using skills. Studying and sharing and talking at length is very different
from instinct and muscle memory that comes with practical experience and
deliberate practice.

Some people look like they're doing it all. They're not. You are just as capable
of doing as much as them. Focus on what's real, not on how much you share.
