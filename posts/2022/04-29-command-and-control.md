Not always is leadership demanding something of you, your team, or your org,
from a place of command and control. You can be both mission driven, and
occasionally receive something specific of great importance from on high. This
is to be expected, but only works in a shared world view of this being the
exception, not the rule, and in the presence of strong two way trust between
teams building the product and leadership setting the vision.
