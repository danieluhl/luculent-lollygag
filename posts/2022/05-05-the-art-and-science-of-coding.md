Coding will always have some art. But with automated code generation like Github
Copilot the trend is looking to be twoards more science at the edges, and
pushing the art to the automated tooling building.

We see this trend towards science both on business side with lean practices (see
Lean Enterprise book) and with increase in emphasis on TDD, type systems, and
functional programming blends.

To be future proof in your 30+ year coding career, always be aiming towards
teams building the tooling (platform teams) or be the best at the science.
