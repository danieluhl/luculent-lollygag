title: 'Leaders Focus on Outputs'

Inputs are not bad, but focusing on them by spending time and frequently talking
about them has been shown ineffective for changing markets, innovation, or
[discipline/motivation](05-10-motivation-vs-discipline). Instead focus on
outputs.

## Inputs example (de-emphasize)

- Planning (OKRs)
- Time estimates
- Standards and templates
- SLOs/SLIs
- Hiring

## Outputs (do emphasize)

- Customer value
- Rate of change
- Learning and mastery
- Growth and scale of impact
- Retention

## Notice these line up nicely :)

| Inputs                  | Outputs                         |
| ---                     | ---                             |
| Planning (OKRs)         | Customer Value                  |
| Time Estimates          | Change Flow Rate                |
| Standards and Templates | Rate of learning/mastery        |
| SLOs SLIs               | Customer Value Impact and Scale |
| Hiring                  | Cultivating culture (retention) |
