In meditation, when you catch your mind wandering, this is the moment of clarity
in the present. The catching youself is the meditating.

In life we are perpetually building towards something. Some day will come when
all the prep is done and we can finally start living (retirement?). The catch
is, we're already living and there is no dress rehearsal. The more we can catch
ourselves failing to live now in this moment, the more life we can live.

I lost 10lbs. from trying the habit breaker of no Amazon purchases for a month.
Injecting this discipline permiated into several other parts of my life
naturally.

I've found what I wear in the morning greately affects my productivity in the
morning.
