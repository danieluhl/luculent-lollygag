## A – Have I practiced abstinence this week?

Removed reddit and tiktok from phone. Spent more time on alto's adventure which
is probably a step up assuming it doesn't get out of hand.

## E – Have I exercised well this week?

No dedicated exercise but did get a lot of yard work done in the unseasonably
warm weather.

## I – What have I done for myself this week?

Since it was vacation, almost everything was whatever I wanted to do. Most
notably we got a solo stove and I've been doing a fireside meditations that have
felt great.

## O – What have I done for others this week?

Looking to play more with Reyan, he is growing up quickly and still wants to
play all the time.

## U – Do I have any unexpressed emotions?

I've been feeling exceptionally free lately - noticing when I am internally
asking for permission for things I shouldn't ever really need permission for and
deciding to "unclench" and allow myself permission.

## Y – The “yeah” factor; what brought me joy this week?

Getting the beach tent out on the deck and playing trains in it with Reyan was
awesome in this nice weather. Certainly not what I was expecting to be doing on
newyears eve.
