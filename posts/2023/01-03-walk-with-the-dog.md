I went to the yard the other day and found so much
dog poo. Where did all this come from? When did they have time? Have I really
not picked up in this long? Small steps add up quicker than we realize, both
positive and negative.

## Positive

Incremental progress with [deliberate practice](04-21-nine-guidelines-for-deliberate-practice)

- Exercise
- Not drinking
- Tool sharpening
- Reading
- Projects

## Negative

- Code debt, refactoring abstractions
- Dog poo
- Time on media
- Time gaming
- Weeding the garden and fixing things around the house

Best to make persistent, validated, incremental steps with emperical results,
both in the maintenance of future negatives, and the pursuit of cumulative
positives.
